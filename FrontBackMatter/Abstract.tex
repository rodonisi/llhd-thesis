\chapter*{Abstract}
The current hardware design workflow is sparse,  with tools being mostly monolithic and proprietary. This introduces unnecessary redundancies, as well as possible implementation discrepancies between tools. LLHD brings a simple IR, yet still able to fully capture existing HDLs. MLIR provides a powerful and open source infrastructure to implement LLHD and enable a new and open source HDL workflow.
