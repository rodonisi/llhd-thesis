\chapter*{Abstract}
The current hardware design workflow is sparse, with tools being mostly monolithic and proprietary. This introduces unnecessary redundancy in their implementation, as well as possible discrepancies in the interpretation of the complex HDL standards.
Open-source tools face the challenge of tackling the vast standards defined for well-established HDLs, often having to resort to supporting only a subset of them, never really being able to compete with the commercial alternatives.
We propose an open-source LLHD representation for MLIR, together with a simulator that makes use of this representation, capable of fully simulating real-world designs as complex as a RISC-V processor core with simulation performance up to $1.4\times$ faster than a well-established commercial simulator, and otherwise running only $2.4\times$ slower on average.
We show the benefits we obtain by having an LLHD representation in MLIR, and the performance potential present in leveraging this representation in software simulation.
