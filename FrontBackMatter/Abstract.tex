\chapter*{Abstract}
The current hardware design workflow is sparse,  with tools being mostly monolithic and proprietary. This introduces unnecessary redundancies, as well as possible implementation discrepancies between tools. LLHD \cite{Schueki2020} brings a simple IR, yet still able to fully capture existing HDLs. MLIR \cite{Lattner2020} provides a powerful and open source infrastructure to implement LLHD and enable a new and open source HDL workflow.
% Today's digital design workflow is very sparse, with the available tools being monolithic and mostly proprietary. Ranging from design synthesis, simulation, and formal verification, each tool uses its own implementationof the HDL specification. This introduces unnecessary redundancy, as well as possible discrepancies in how designs are lowered. With LLHD \cite{Schueki2020} we propose a simple IR capable of fully caputring the exixsting HDL while still being able to represent digital circuits along the whole toolchain, with possible performance improvements over the competition.
