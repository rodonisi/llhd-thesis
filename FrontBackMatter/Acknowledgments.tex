\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to start by thanking \myProf, for allowing me to write this thesis in the SPCL group.

\noindent A special thank you goes to my supervisors, \mySupervisorOne and \mySupervisorTwo, for their always precise and thorough explanations and suggestions.

\noindent I would also like to express my gratitude to Jean-Michel Gorius for his meticulous code reviews and suggestions, helping me out a lot getting started with \textit{C++} and MLIR.

\noindent Finally, I would like to thank Martin Erhart for collaborating with me on our dialect definition, always putting a lot of thought and effort into his work and in our discussions.
